About this lab**\n","\n","- In this lab we will explore and use Melbourne housepricing dataset.  Each row in the dataset is a housing sale and columns are the features of the sold house/appartment.\n","\n","\n","- The goal is to predict the price of new sales. We will build two supervised models: regression models and artificial neural network. ML pipeline outlined in the theory part of the course will be followed. \n","\n","\n","**3.
